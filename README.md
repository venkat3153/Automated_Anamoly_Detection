Automated Anomaly Detection for Predictive Maintenance
Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning pipeline to detect anomalies in equipment data for predictive maintenance. By identifying potential system failures in advance, this project helps prevent breakdowns, reduce risks, and optimize maintenance schedules.

The solution involves:

Data Analysis: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and trends in the dataset.
Feature Engineering: Cleaning and transforming the data for improved model performance.
Model Training: Building a machine learning model for binary anomaly detection.
Model Optimization: Fine-tuning the model using hyperparameter tuning.
Deployment Plan: Outlining steps to integrate the trained model into production.
